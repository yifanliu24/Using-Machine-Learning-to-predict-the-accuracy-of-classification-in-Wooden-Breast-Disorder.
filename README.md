Several gene expression studies have been previously conducted to characterize molecular basis of Wooden Breast myopathy (WB) in commercial broiler chickens. These studies have generally used a limited sample size and relied on a binary disease outcome (WB-affected vs unaffected), which are appropriate for an initial investigation. However, to identify biomarkers of disease severity and development, it is necessary to use a large number of samples with a varying degree of disease severity. Therefore, in this study, we assayed a relatively large number of samples (n = 89) harvested from the pectoralis major muscle unaffected (U), partially affected (P) and markedly affected (A) chickens.
